        %p
          Journey's self-titled debut album, Journey, was released in 1975 on
          the Columbia Records label. Unlike their later recordings, the debut
          release is a progressive rock album, in the jazz-fusion vein. It is
          the only album to include guitarist George Tickner among their
          personnel. This lineup of Journey showcased their considerable talent
          as musicians on jazz-flavored mix, progressive rock epics like "Of a
          Lifetime", "Kohoutek", "Mystery Mountain", and "Topaz".

        %p
          Journey's second album, Look into the Future, was released in January
          of 1976 on the Columbia Records label. For their second album, the
          members of Journey toned down the overt progressiveness of their
          first, self-titled release, in favor of a more focused, commercial
          approach. Despite that, Look Into the Future still retains some of
          the experimental approach and sound of the debut, especially in the
          title track and "I'm Gonna Leave You". Guitarist George Tickner had
          left the band, leaving members Greg Rolie (lead vocals/keyboards),
          Neal Schon (guitar), Ross Valory (bass), and Aynsley Dunbar (drums).

        %p
          Journey's third album, Next, was released in 1977 (see 1977 in music).
          Journey continued the formula from 1976's "Look into the Future" but
          this album retains much of Journey's jazz-flavored progressiveness
          from the first album. Songs include the opening, moody number,
          "Spaceman", as well as standout rocker "Hustler", the odd timing
          instrumental "Nickel And Dime", and the epic "I Would Find You".
          The instrumental entitled "Cookie Duster" was listed in very early
          pressings of the album, though not actually included on the pressings,
          and then not listed on the cover art at all. Many fans feel this song
          is one of their best instrumentals and should have been included. It
          was later released on their

          Journey's fourth album, Infinity, was released in January of 1978 on
          the Columbia Records label. Looking for a stronger lead vocalist,
          Journey briefly enlisted front man Robert Fleischman and even recorded
          one track, "For You", which would later appear on the
          %span
            Time

          collection. Fleischman was soon replaced by Steve Perry. Perry and
          Neal Schon penned their first song together, "Patiently", which would
          appear on the new studio album. Other popular singles include "Lights"
          and "Wheel in the Sky", the latter written by temporary front man
          Fleischman. Journey's manager, Herbie Herbert, enlisted producer Roy
          Thomas Baker to engineer Infinity. This produced a layered sound
          approach, similar to his work with Queen, as demonstrated on tracks
          such as "Winds of March". The addition of Perry solidified their more
          mainstream sound and helped Journey attain their highest chart success
          to date. Infinity also marked the last appearance of drummer Aynsley
          Dunbar as a member of the band &mdash; he left to join Jefferson
          Starship.

          singles: "After the Fall" (#23), "Send Her My Love" (#23),
          "Faithfully" (#12), and "Separate Ways" (#8), and a rock radio hit
          in "Chain Reaction." All of the first five tracks (the album's first
          side) had videos created for them. Arguably the album would have been
          an even bigger success had it not been for the last minute decision by
          Michael Dilbeck, the bandâ€™s longtime A&R man, to switch two tracks;
          he put "Back Talk" and "Troubled Child" in, and took out "Ask the
          Lonely" and "Only the Young." Jonathan Cain had more input on this
          album; not only did he once again help co-write all the tracks, he was
          the main pen behind "Faithfully", and there is more emphasis on
          keyboards.

          Journey also had a new drummer, Deen Castronovo, for this record. The

          its leakage onto the Internet, the band decided to delay its release
          in the United States. Due to feedback from fans who heard the leaked
          version of Arrival, the band decided to record two harder rocking
          songs, which were included on the American version of the album.
          Arrival produced a minor adult contemporary hit with the ballad
          "All the Way", while rock fans were more satisfied with songs like
          "Higher Place" and the two new tracks on the American release,

          stadiums across the U.S., and for all intents and purposes inventing
          the AOR radio format (Album Oriented Rock). During the bands'
