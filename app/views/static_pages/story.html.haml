  %span.text-uppercase On a sunny afternoon
  in November 1991, the three horsemen of Journey rode together one more time.  In front of more than a quarter-million people spread across the Polo Fields in Golden Gate Park, Steve Perry, Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain join a day long roster of San Francisco rock greats who paid heartfelt tribute to impresario Bill Graham, killed the previous weekend in a helicopter crash. The band had not been together in five years.
%p
Without it being said, the participation of Journey at this signal convocation of the San Francisco music scene anointed the oft-maligned band, finally, as one of the pantheon of the city’s storied rock groups. Along with the Grateful Dead, Santana, John Fogerty, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and the performing that day, Journey claimed its just place in the annals of San Francisco rock, a place only respect, not recognition or record sales alone, could secure.
%p
In San Francisco, Journey may have sold more records than any other group or artist from the city, but the elitists behind the scenes never really embraced the band.  Journey made the mistake of being too successful, too straight-forward, too unpretentious in a city that celebrates the underdog, the hipster, the oddball.
%p
But the story of Journey is a gritty tale of dedication and determination that paralleled the march of the city’s beloved San Francisco ‘49ers football team into the Super Bowl about the same time Journey achieved similar status in the rock world. It is the kind of triumph over adversity and impossible odds this city has celebrated since the fabled gold rush that first put the town on the map over a century age.  The sound of Journey not only accounted for more than 30 million records sold, but helped shape the American pop music spectrum in those final days before MTV. The group sold millions of concert tickets over more than a dozen years of nearly endless touring through nine different editions, leaving behind a persuasive recorded legacy of nine albums that, three years after the group quietly slipped into silence, was culled for a “Greatest Hits” album that sold three million copies. The music, which remains, speaks for itself.
%h2 In The Beginning
%p
  At age sixteen, teenage guitar prodigy Neal Schon, son of a music teacher, faced the enviable dilemma of choosing between invitations to join two bands already world famous. Eric Clapton wanted Schon to play with Derek and the Dominoes after Schon sat in with the band at a 1970 performance at the Berkeley Community Theatre.  At the same time, Carlos Santana asked Schon to hook up with his band, currently one if the hottest attractions in the universe.
%p
  He signed on with Santana in time to record the band’s self-titled third album and witness, first-hand, the disintegration of the original unit that blasted off from the Woodstock stage, as the group’s namesake turned to a more ethereal sound and life. Schon formed and recorded casually with Azteca, a latin-rock big band that flared briefly on the San Francisco scene, and linked forces with Sly and the Family Stone alumni bassist Larry Graham and drummer Gregg Errico, which evolved into Graham’s initial version of Graham Central Station.  He had just left Graham’s band when Herbie Herbert approached him.
%p
  Few managers figure as prominently in the story of their band as Herbert does with Journey. As road manager for Santana, Herbert came to know Schon and, like everybody else who heard the young fastballer play during those days, he recognized the immense potential of this bristling talent.  Herbert wanted to form a band around him and Schon agreed. Herbert recruited bassist Ross Valery and guitarist George Tickner, who he knew from his own early days in the East Bay as manager of a band called Frumious Bandersnatch.  Drummer Prairie Prince belonged to the Tubes, a band Herbert alsoco-managed at the time (although not for long).
%p
  Keyboardist Gregg Rolie left the wreckage of Santana for Seattle, where he opened a restaurant with his father and the money he saved from his years in rock. The business teetered on the brink of disaster and, even though he managed to sell the restaurant, Rolie was still financially involved when Herbert reached him and summoned him back to San Francisco in June 1973.
%p
  They were gunslingers with itchy trigger fingers and no plan. At first, the group was called the Golden Gate Rhythm Section and the idea was they would provide accompaniment for musicians who wanted to record in San Francisco, where the music scene was bustling with activity -- a kind of rock version of Memphis’ Booker T. and the MG’s.  Within days, however, the musicians decide to pursue a more ambitious course and began to prepare material for an album of their own.  Tickner supplied many of the blueprints.  Some of his compositions were little more than chord changes with whimsical names like “Sketches of Pacheco,” but he laid out a unique floorplan for the band.
%p
  “He came up with chordings I have never heard,” said Rolie. “He had these massive hands and he would de-tune his strings and come up with these voicings that nobody else could.”
%p
  Before the group even came up with a name, the band recorded a series of tapes at Wally Heider’s Studios and the results were broadcast on the San Francisco rock radio powerhouse, KSAN-FM. Listeners were invited to submit entries in a name-the band contest, although it was Herbert’s associate John Villaneuva who suggested Journey.
%p
  After more than 6 months of rehearsals, the band made its debut on the New Year’s Eve bill at Winterland 1973-4, followed by a headline performance the following dayat the Crater Festival in Hawaii, where Santana had appeared a number of times.  But Prairie Prince wouldn’t commit to membership.  He moved from Phoenix to San Francisco with the musicians who formed the Tubes and beyond the loyalty to his friends, he liked the other band better.  “They were more artistic,” said Prince, “I felt like it was more my band.”
%p
  Every drummer in town trooped through the rehearsal hall without success.  Aynsley Dunbar returned home from touring with David Bowie to find a message from Herbert waiting for him. Schon and Herbert flew to Los Angeles to meet with the noted sideman for John Mayall and Frank Zappa, among others. Dunbar didn’t know who they were -- although Schon know him from having seen him play with Zappa the previous year -- but the tape they played for him knocked Dunbar out.  They offered him a full partnership in the band. He flew up to San Francisco on February 1 and four days later, the newly assembled Journey played the Great American Music Hall. The repertoire relied heavily on instrumentals, Santana-flavored without the Latin rhythms, like “Kohoutek” or “Topaz.” Rolie sang a heavy rock version of the Beatles song, “It’s All Too Much.”
%p
  Herbert immediately booked the band anywhere he could, which occasionally resulted in some rather odd bills.  In March, Journey opened a show at the Berkeley Community Theater as opening act for soul man Bobby Womack.  The heavy rock didn’t go over all that well with the almost entirely black audience. Well before signing a record contract, the band hit the road, playing for audiences who didn’t know Journey was.  By the end of the year, however, a deal with Columbia Records had been negotiated and the band began recording in CBS Studio A in San Francisco with producer Roy Halee, distinguished staff producer famed for his work with Simon and Garfunkel “Bridge Over Troubled Water”). An old school company man dispatched by Columbia president Clive Davis to oversee the CBS recording facility in San Francisco, Halee steered the initial solo efforts by both Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel from his new post, but had not otherwise cut any major hit records from the San Francisco outpost. Journey, the label’s first important local signing since taking over the facility, was an obvious assignment for the pipe-smoking fastidious engineer-producer with a wall full of gold records and a desk littered with Grammy Awards.
%p
  In some ways, Halee and Journey were mismatched.  The slow, scrupulous producer was capable of stalling a session for several hours while he waited for the arrival of a proper microphone, leaving the young musicians restlessly banging pinball machines in the studio game room. He had never produced a rock band before and recorded the scorching, shrieking music at low volume levels that left evident amounts of tape hiss on the finished master. But Halee, also gave the band gleaming, polished sonics entirely missing from the original demo tapes.
%p
  Released in April 1975, the debut Journey album rampaged on a fiery instrumental sound interspersed with a few vocals by Rolie, a superbly proficient musicianly performance built on dense chords and complex changes.  “Fusion music was very popular at the time,” said Rolie.  “We figured we’re players -- let’s do it.”
%p
  Herbert dispatched the band on the road opting to establish the group as a concert attraction, rather than waiting for radio to respond to this somewhat difficult album.  There were the inevitable peculiar bookings.  Dunbar remembered the band getting booked as special guests on a country music show, where the heavy rock didn’t go any better than on the Bobby Womack show.  But by September, the band was sharing top billing with local favorites Montrose at the fall season opening of the Bill Graham rock emporium in San Francisco, Winterland, peppering the set with material from an album about to be recorded.

%h2 Look Into the Future
%p
The road never ended.  When the band wasn’t in the studio, Journey was touring. George Tickner opted out of the grueling grind and left the band to enter medical school.  The band’s second album “Look Into The Future,” released in January 1976, shifted the group away from the epic instrumentals of the first album and the third album, “Next,” found the band flexing new found vocal abilities.  Band members had been taking voice lessons at Family Music School in Sausalito and Schon even contributed a lead vocal to the third Journey album, “Next,” a record that determinedly moved the group further in the direction of songmsanship, although lyric writing for the album was largely left to drummer Dunbar, an absolute novice at songwriting.
%p
But progress was slow, no breakthroughs forthcoming and the record company running out of patience. “After three albums, we were told ‘get a singer, get some hits songs or you’re off the label,’” said Dunbar.
%p
Robert Fleischman was signing with a band in Chicago when Colorado-based concert producer Barry Fey heard a tape of the vocalist, invited him to come to Denver, and signed Fleischman to a management contract.  In rapid order, Fleischman put together a band and played a showcase date attended by various label executives. Two weeks later, he was flying to San Francisco at the suggestion of a Columbia representative who attended the Denver showcase. Herbert met him at the airport and drove him straight to Studio Instrument Rentals, where the band was rehearsing.  “They had played together so long and were so tight,” the vocalist recalled, “it was like having rockets in your back pockets.”
%p
Before leaving to open the Emerson, Lake and Palmer tour in June 1977, the band wrote ands rehearsed almost an entirely new repertoire with Fleischman in the vocalist’s chair.  Diane Valory, wife of the Journey bassist, had a poem that included the lines “the wheels in my head keep turning,” which guitarist Schon changed to “wheel in the sky” (Whatever that means,” he said) and gave to Fleischman to complete the lyrics.  The newly honed vocal skills of the quartet blended behind the Robert Plantish lead vocals of Fleischman like a glee club.  Gone were the Santana overtones of the early Journey; suddenly the band created fresh, powerful mainstream rock.  The group walked across Folsom Street from S.I.R. to CBS studios and laid down a series of demos of the new tunes in preparation for a new album, the band’s fourth, which chart an entirely different musical direction.
%p
Even though the band had yet to crack the mainstream to any great degree, Journey albums and live performances had built a slim but fervent core of fans, who greeted Fleischman with skepticism every night he stepped onstage with the band to sing three unfamiliar new songs. ”All these gigs, I would come on during the third song and it was wild,” he said.  “The first rows were packed with devout Journey fanatics.  They were like a cult.  I had hit a home run every night because I had the whole front row flipping me off every night.”
%p
Eventually, Fleischman proved overly demanding and, following a performance in Fresno, Herbet fired the singer. Fleischman finished the tour the following night in Oakland and later drove back to Los Angeles.
%p
But it wasn’t mere arrogance that brought Fleischman’s departure.  It was a tape Herbert had in his hands from another vocalist.

%h2 The Portuguese Cousin
%p
The first time Steve Perry heard Neal Schon play, the guitar whiz was sitting in with Azteca at the Kabuki Theatre in San Francisco and Schon gave Perry and his cousin a ride home afterwards. The next time they crossed paths, Journey was playing the Starwood in Hollywood and Perry went backstage and chatted briefly with the band, although none of the musicians yet knew he was a singer.
He grew up in Hanford, a small Central Valley agricultural community not unlike the background of film director George Lucas, who would draw his first cinematic success from his childhood memories, "American Graffiti."
%p
He played in bands around Sacramento, first working as a drummer before switching to vocals exclusively, and spent years in Los Angeles knocking on record industry doors. Finally with his band Alien Project, close to being signed with Columbia Records, the bass player was killed in a car crash.
%p
Dejected and depressed, Perry headed home to hang up his rock and roll shoes. He had spent the better part of ten years, a large slice out of his youth, pursuing his dream and in the wake of sudden death, it looked as elusive as smoke in the sunset. His mother urged him to stick it out, but Perry was working on a farm, playing in clubs at night when Herbert called.

%h2 1977 - 1978
%p
The Alien Project tape landed on Herbert's desk and he went through the ceiling when he heard Perry's voice. He convinced Perry to hook up with the band on tour, traveling under the subterfuge that he was John Villanueva's Portuguese cousin. At a sound check before a concert in Long Beach, Herbert arranged for Fleischman to be otherwise occupied while Perry joined the band to sing one of Fleischman's songs. It was all Herbert needed to hear. Fleischman was gone within days.
"I wasn't completely sold on Perry," said Rolie. "I don't think anybody was." But backstage at the Swing Auditorium in San Bernardino, Perry strapped on a bass and played a song he had nearly completed called "Lights" and the other musicians began to harmonize along with him. "It dawned on me right then that this could really be great," said Rolie.
%p
In Denver, where Perry was sharing a hotel room with Schon, the morning after a show, Schon picked up an acoustic guitar and strummed out a few chords. Less than an hour later, almost five years since Schon drove Perry home from the Azteca show, the pair had written their first song, "Patiently."
%p
On October 28, 1977, Steve Perry, dressed all in white, walked on stage for the first time with the band for the encores at a special three-night run at the 600-seat Old Waldorf in San Francisco. He sang two songs, including "Lights."
%p
For the next album, Journey turned to producer Roy Thomas Baker, a jolly madman from across the Atlantic who was best known at the time for his rather gothic productions with Queen.  The sessions started at the San Francisco studio, His Master’s Wheels.  During a drunken celebration over a successful guitar solo, somebody poured a bottle of beer over Baker’s head and he retaliated by grabbing a fire extinguisher and blanketing the studio in an eye-stinging for.  When the air cleared, the chemicals in the fire extinguisher had settled into a corrosive film, which, for the moment at least, appeared to have destroyed all the delicate recording equipment in the studio.  The damage turned out to be much less than initially presumed, although not before the studio owner cleaned Baker’s clock with one swift blow. The sessions moved to Cherokee Studio in Los Angeles.
%p
The album, “Infinity,” was released in January 1978, adorned with the striking cover art from the same artists, Stanley Mouse and Alton Kelley, responsible for most of the Grateful Dead emblemology.  Concert producer Bill Graham went so far as to return to the playback party at Studio Instrument Rentals after his roller skating lessons  and termed the album “a lovely monster” in a congratulatory telegram the following morning.

%h2 Evolution
%p
Back to the battlefield went the warriors. Herbert kept his squadron on a strict schedule: nine months touring, three months recording, no vacation. This time out, Herbert risked sending Journey off as a headline act, although the band hadn’t scored anything remotely resembling a hit record. They may not be selling records, but they could sell tickets, he reasoned.
%p
“The Infinity tour was called the infinity tour for a very good reason,” said Rolie. The first headline concert took place in Chicago and sold the 1800-seat Riviera Theater. A few months later, the band returned to Chicago and played the 4000-seat Aragon Hall. The tour eventually criss-crossed through Chicago eleven times that year, including no fewer than three stops to perform concerts. The band traveled for awhile in a Winnebago so feeble they literally had to push it into the last show. In between soundmen at the start of the tour, vocalist Perry would sit at the mixing console, bring the sound up and get the band set before dashing back stage to change into his trademark tails and make his third song entrance. But when FM radio picked up on “Wheel In The Sky,” the musicians felt the impact at the box office. Journey finished the marathon campaign performing in front of capacity arena crowds at top of a bill that also featured Montrose and Van Halen. By the time the “Infinity” tour was complete, the band had played a staggering 172 cities in the U.S., Canada and Europe.
%p
Journey had turned a corner. The all-important hit single that could establish the band across the boards still eluded Journey -- “Wheel In The Sky,” could rise no further than #57 on the Billboard charts and subsequent “Infinity” singles, “Anytime” and “Lights,” fared no better -- but with the FM airplay, the band vaulted ranks. Journey justified Herbert’s touring gamble and provide a bonafide concert attraction. Slowly the band had evolved and, with the addition of vocalist Perry, the shift from instrumental specialists to song styles was complete. ”Perry had a lot of ideas,” said Rolie, “and he would direct us. With him, we learned how to play for a singer. We would ask ourselves ‘what was the most dynamic thing for a singer?’ Before that, we played just to play.”
%p
Perry galvanized this new direction. Not only did his searing tenor glide over the storming sound of the band with ease and grace, but he was proving to be a facile and gifted songwriter who brought out previously undiscovered sides of Schon’s skills in that department. “There was a chemistry,” said Schon, “where we could sit down and put together a song quickly with just an acoustic guitar. It was a brand new type of music for me.”
%p
The first victim of this new direction was Dunbar. “He was a phenomenal drummer, if you let him play a lot of drums,” said Schon. “He’s an octopus on the drums, but he was playing way too much for the simplicity of the songs. He would warm up during our songs for his drum solos.”
%p
Nobody questioned the abundantly obvious musical taken of the drummer, simply whether his skills suited the band’s new direction. “We all made the decision,” said Rolie.
%p
Every night during the final leg of the “Infinity” tour, Schon and Perry watched drummer Steve Smith backing up guitarist Ronnie Montrose. The tour served as Smith’s audition with the band and he was offered Dunbar’s suddenly vacated chair in October. A graduate of the prestigious Berklee School of Music, Smith came to the attention of Schon and some of the other band members when they saw him playing with fusion violinist Jean-Luc Ponty.
%p
Smith had tried out for the jobs with both Montrose and jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard at the same time and was offered both. He chose Montrose because he thought the rock experience would broaden his percussion palette. On the tour with Journey, he watched the band nightly and grew to be a fan of the music, bought the albums and listened to them at home long before the band approached him about joining.
%p
His first assignment after coming on board was as unusual project for Journey, a King Biscuit Flower Hour broadcast the band assembled over the period of several days at CBS Studios. Instead of simply performing the band’s standard live set for broadcast on the nationwide radio program, Journey opted for a much more ambitious effort.
%p
With the Tower of Power horn section and background vocalists Annie Sampson and Jo Baker of Stoneground, Journey was transformed into a regulation rhythm and blues outfit. Backing up guests like Tom Johnston of the Dobbie Brothers, the band tried out soul material like Sam Cooke’s “Good times” or Sam ad Dave’s “Hold On I’m Coming” and blues numbers Robert Johnson’s “Crossroads” or Albert King’s “Born Under a Bad Sign.” Sadly, the final tape, which revealed a side of Journey never displayed anywhere else, has never been heard, with the exception of the release of “Good Times.”

%h2 The Platinum Plateau
%p
Slowly but inexorably, “Infinity” finally broke the platinum barriers for Journey. Once again under supervision of producer Roy Thomas Baker, the band returned to the studio to record the follow-up “Evolution.” On the heels of the March 1979 release, the band launched its most ambitious tour yet, a taxing seven months that took Journey to Europe, Japan, and across the United States, where the band would perform 70 dates alone, including headlining shows at the Oakland Coliseum Stadium and Comiskey Park in Chicago. The band set a new attendance record in Detroit where 48,000 fans attended four sold out shows over one weekend at Cobo Hall.
%p
“Lovin’, Touchin’, Squeezin’,” the second single released from the set, eased its way into the Top 20, landing Journey firmly on car radios for the first time. The album sold over 800,000 in the first three months of release, even before the hit single spun off.
%p
Herbert took charge of every detail of the band’s business. A staff of more than thirty employees handled everything from equipment on the road to artwork for tour merchandising and album packaging, including sound, lights and stage design for all the band’s concerts.
%p
In November, the band went into Automatt Studios, formerly CBS Studios, to begin the next album. Instead of Roy Baker, the band brought together their live sound engineer, Kevin Elson, and Baker’s assistant, Geoff Workman, to serve as producers and work proceeded more than with Baker. Out of nineteen songs, the band laid down tracks for fourteen and finished eleven for the album. Perry recorded almost all of his vocals live in the studio.
%p
At the release of “Departure” in March 1980, Journey easily ranked among the top rock bands in the country without benefit of scoring either a Top Ten album or single. To capitalize on the band’s growing stature, Columbia Records released a selection of tracks the previous fall from the first three, pre-Perry albums title “In the Beginning.” “Departure” took off instantly. Within two months, the new album joined its two immediate predecessors in the platinum ranks of million-sellers. And still the tours ground on.
%p
In Japan, following five sold out shows in Osaka and Toyko, Journey engaged in another unconventional experiment destined never to be heard in the U.S. The band adjourned to Tokyo’s Shinonomachi Studios, where Journey spent two weeks recording the soundtrack to “Dream After Dream,” the debut film by Kenzo Takada, Japan’s most popular designer. The almost all instrumental album, released only in Japan, captured Journey improvising on bits of melodies and phrases guitarist Schon supplied. Rolie found himself slamming out dissonant chords in front of a movie screen, ad libbing background music to a desert scene.

%h2 81
%p
Matthew Schon, the guitarist’s father, flew over to supply orchestrations and strings and horns were added to various pieces. Perry contributed vocals on several tracks including ”Little Girl.” The entire project showed Journey in an unvarnished way the band hadn’t dared since the very earliest days. In Japan the bands was stitching together a nearly abstract tapestry of sound, confident and colorful in ways less creative musicians could never have managed.
%p
But, at the end of the tour, Rolie announced he would be leaving the band. The stolid capstan of the band, after spending virtually his entire adult life on the road between Santana and Journey, decided there must be something more to life than arenas, hotels and airports. He thought that he might want to have a family. “Too much pressure, too much work,” he said.
%p
It was an idea that had rattled around in his head for at least a year, and with the upcoming live album already in the can, the juncture seemed like a good hopping off place. He hade already spotted his replacement playing in the band opening the “Departure” tour, the Babys. “I picked Jonathan Cain,” said Rolie. “He could play the guitar and I knew Neil wanted someone who could also play guitar.”
%p
Back home, the band went into Berekley’s Fantasy Studios to cut one additional track, “The Party’s Over (Hopelessly In Love),” for the two record live set, “Captured.” Free-lance keyboardist Tim Gorman came in t o polish off the simple keyboard part.

%h2 The Great Escape
%p
When Journey drafted Jonathan Cain, they knew he could play keyboards and guitar. They didn’t know he possessed any special songwriting skills. He grew up in Chicago and went to Nashville to write songs. He recorded a 1977 solo album, “Windy City Breakdown,” for Bearsville Records and found his way to Los Angeles, where he was introduced to the Babys. He eventually auditioned for the vacant keyboard position and, after being called back several times, won the job. He was making the grand sum of $250 a week and living in a small North Hollywood apartment when he left for three months on the road with the Babys, opening for Journey.
%p
Night after night, he watched the shows from backstage. The Perry and Schon combination seemed magical to him. He grew engrossed in the band’s music. One night, Herbert and Schon pulled him into a limousine after a concert. “Hey J.C.,” said Herbert. “You’re going too be our next keyboard player.” “You’re the guy,” echoed Schon.Cain didn’t believe their jests until he was back home, the phone rang in his apartment and Herbert was on the line offering him a job. He dropped the phone. He arrived at the Oakland rehearsal hall Journey maintained to discover Schon saved “hours of hours” of riffs, notions and thoughts and half-baked musical ideas, on cassettes. He began serving as group librarian, keeping track of everybody’s licks.
%p
“The thing that was missing was writing our audience into our songs, those people who were so spiritual and loyal to the band… Just a city boy… What I changed is I started writing about the people that care about the band,” said Cain. “You’d go to their concerts and there would be 23,000 people and it was like church, sacred.”
%p
Cain fell right in. He would throw his portable Wurlitzer keyboard in the back of his van and drive up to Perry’s house. Tunes poured out of the pair with Schon ready to sew them together with sinewy guitar lines. Perry and Cain shared a love of the Motown and traditional rhythm and blues and Cain was confident their collaboration would bear fruit.
%p
“I knew it wasn’t going to take a whole lot because of the way the guy could sing,” he said. “All we had to do was stay sincere.”
%p
Cain co-wrote every song on the next album. But when the time came for him to make his stage debut with the band, June 13 at the Mountain Aire Festival in the sleepy Gold Rush town of Angel’s Camp four hours outside San Francisco, Journey downplayed the tunes from the soon-to-be-released “Escape,” performing a mere four songs from the new album and bringing the show to a predictable pandemonium with the tried-and-true “The Party’s Over,” “Wheel In The Sky” and “Lovin’, Touchin’, Squeezin’” to close the show.
%p
But six months later, by the time “Escape” tour rolled into San Francisco proper, virtually the entire set revolved around songs from the new album. The first two singles from the album, “Who’s Cryin’ Now and “Don’t Stop Believin’,” both stormed the Top Ten and the Third, a slow, spared ballad called “Open Arms” was scorching up the charts. The album struck No. 1. Sales passed the five million mark. Truly, Journey had arrived. Joining the band on stage was virtually the entire roster of the San Francisco ‘49ers, on their way to the team’s first ever Super Bowl victory.
%p
Playing multiple dates before capacity crowds in what seemed like every city in the country, with “Escape” lodged firmly in the upper reaches of the best selling charts, Journey cast a tall shadow across the entire rock landscape. Chosen to appear with the Rolling Stones at Philadelphia’s J.F.K. Stadium as supporting act on the opening show of the biggest tour of the year, Journey met with round indifference from an audience of Stones-crazed fanatics who couldn’t care less if Journey had the biggest-selling album in the country or not.
%p
But the juggernaut couldn’t be stopped. Five million albums, two million concert tickets, and another million T-Shirts added up to Journey becoming one of the most dominant bands of the era. To take them to the next level Herbert and the band planned a coast-to-coast stadium tour in the summer of 1982 that would serve notice to one and all of Journey’s stature in America.
%p
All of the dates were in place when the musicians informed Herbert they wanted to take a break from all the touring. After two punishing “Escape” tours back-to-back, they told him to cancel any plans for a summer stadium tour. When Bill Graham got wind of the band’s refusal to tour, he asked for a personal audience with the group. No stranger to Graham’s persuasiveness, Herbert duly escorted the determined impresario into the band’s rehearsal hall, where the promoter unleashed his full powers, regaling the band with reasons why the group should play, at least, the Bay Area and Los Angeles area stadium dates he planned with his company. When he was done, the group remained unconvinced.
%p
Graham dropped to his knees and clasped his hands together in supplication “Please,” Graham implored, never at a loss for dramatics. “I’m begging you.” He got his dates. Herbert also quickly arranged shows at the Cotton Bowl and Astrodome over one weekend.
%p
The production value of these stadium shows raised the stakes in the rock arms race in a single stroke. Alongside giant painted scrims covering the speakers, enormous 60-foot Eidaphor video screens relayed the onstage action to the crowds as far as a quarter-mile away in the rear of the third deck. Simultaneously, on stage a state of the art lighting system highlighted the energy of the band’s live performance. The sound system swept the entire spectrum with microscopic scrutiny, from the tinkling of Cain’s grand piano to the roar of Schon’s whooshing guitar.
%p
In one sweep of four concerts, Journey forged a new standard for rock concert production. In fact, the following summer when acts like Simon and Garfunkel, the Police and David Bowie joined Journey on the outdoor concert trail, they all carried identical systems, rented from the Journey’s production company called Nocturne.
%p
“Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)”, a sweeping five-minute epic previewed to concert audiences during the previous year, was released in February 1983, simultaneous with the release of the band’s seventh album, “Frontiers,” and the single smoothly sailed into the Top Ten. Oddly, at least the last minute, after the album had already been sequenced and was ready to go to the pressing plant, an eleventh hour conference with Journey’s long-time A & R man Michael Dilbeck resulted in two glistening tracks -- “Ask the Lonely” and “Only the Young” -- being pulled from the album in favor of “Back Talk” and “Troubled Child.” “Ask the Lonely” was snapped up for the soundtrack of the John Travolta-Olivia Newton John vehicle, “Two of a Kind,” and “Only the Young” would wait two years before finding its destiny in the Top Ten.

%h2 Separate Ways
%p
The stress of success was pulling at the group in many ways. Band members were pursuing projects outside the group. Neal Schon first met keyboardist Jan Hammer years before when Jeff Beck failed to show up for a sound check one afternoon when his band was opening for Journey. Schon stood in for the guitarist and jammed with Hammer, then playing keyboards with beck. The first Hammer-Schon 1982, “Untold passion,” was being followed with a second album release concurrent with the release of “Frontiers.” Schon also discussed cutting a live album with vocalist Sammy Hagar following the end of the tour. Steve Smith recorded a jazz album, “Vital Information.” Cain co-produced an album with his wife, Tane Cain, a model and the daughter of actor Doug McClure. Perry cut a duet with Kenny Loggins and was also talking solo album.
%p
At the end of the “Frontiers” tour Steve Perry moved to Los Angeles to start his solo album. The singer spent 6 months writing and recording with Hollywood studio musicians crafting a polished album. The album, “Street Talk,” came out in April 1984. After having success with the “Oh Sherrie” and “Foolish Heart” singles, Perry returned to San Francisco to begin writing and recording with Journey for what was to become the “Raised On Radio” album. With the lessons learned during his solo project, he returned to the band with a newfound perspective that included a strong desire for greater control of the recording process.
%p
But Perry found it difficult to concentrate. His mother’s terminal illness at the time proved draining. “He would show up at my house,” recalls Cain, “filled with sadness and sorrow. I didn’t what to tell him, except our music, this band, had to go on.”

With Perry as producer and engineer Jim Gaines, producer of the Huey Lewis and the News smash album, “Sports,” serving as associate producer, the band went into the Plant Studios in Sausalito in November 1984 to record the new Journey album. Next door the same day, Lewis and the News started a new record, too, cutting a song called “Power of Love,” a song that would reach the top of the charts before Journey could get halfway through the band’s next album.

That very weekend, members of Journey jetted to Cleveland at the behest of the Make-a-Wish Foundation, an organization that works to fulfill the last wishes of terminally ill children. Kenny Sykaluk, 16, was losing his lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis and he wanted to meet the members of Journey. They brought a platinum record, a ‘49ers helmet and a Walkman with a tape of the next Journey release, the “Frontiers” outtake, “Only the Young,” about to be released on the soundtrack to the movie “Vision Quest,” with its chorus line “Only the young can say they’re free to fly away.”

He died the next morning with that Walkman in his hand, the new Journey record still inside.

Before long, the sessions turned into bad dreams. His mother’s condition deteriorated and Perry kept a helicopter standing by outside the studio. He flew home to the Central Valley at every opportunity. After two months, the band had only completed two tracks. Session players like Bob Glaub and Randy Jackson replaced Valory on the recordings.

With most of the songs being written at home studios with synthesizer bass and rum machines, Smith found difficulties with the material from the start. “We weren’t in on the ground floor,” he said.
%p
Before long, Smith and Valory were ousted from the group altogether due to creative differences and Journey would continue as a three-man band. It was 1985.
%p
It wasn’t long afterward that Schon and Perry butted heads and the guitarist absented himself from much of the creative give-and-take, content to whip out his customary guitaristics in the studio and leave it at that.

The album was completed twice, only to have Journey start over again. The months went by, almost two years worth, and the budget went through the ceiling.
%p
Journey solely tested the marketplace power after a three year absence by insisting the album, “Raised On Radio,” be promoted without any videos with it was released. The band was hastily auditioning drummers for the “Raised On Radio” tour and had little time to pause and shoot a video. The album’s first single, “Be Good to Yourself,” released in April 1986, coasted into the Top Ten.

While session player Randy Jackson made himself available to play bass on the forthcoming tour, drummer Larrie Londin, a Nashville regular, had other commitments. Literally dozens of drummers marched in – and out – of the band’s Oakland rehearsal hall, ranging from world renowned masters like Omar Hakim to a young unknown whose local reputation earned him a shot. Herbert booked and postponed the tour three times, as the band tried to find a new drummer.
%p
The second single came and went without a video and three weeks before the tour was scheduled to start, as the with triumphant 1981 “Escape” tour, at Calaveras County Fairgrounds for the annual Mt. Aire Festival, the band selected drummer Mike Baird. The second single, “Suzanne,” came and went rather rapidly and a camera crew was poised to capture the band’s first concert for an action clip to support “Girl Can’t Help It,” the third single already climbing the charts.
%p
The performance ran smoothly, without incident, the group even tossing in a couple of uncharacteristic oldies, “Jailhouse Rock” and “Reach Out I’ll Be there.” The tightly arranged, r&b-flavored pop from “Raised On Radio” hamstrung Schon slightly and his trademark blitzes were held to a few introductions and passages reserved specifically for his purposes, like the tail end of the retooled “Lovin’ Touchin’, Squeezin’,” which Perry opened with a gospel section backed solely by Cain’s arching chords. Journey included “Oh Sherrie” from the Steve Perry solo album. Clearly this was a different Journey.
%p
At the end of the tour, Jon Cain found himself standing in the lobby of the Anchorage Sheraton after the last show, singing every autograph, waiting for the last fan to leave. “I knew it was over,” he recalled. “It was a sad, sad night.”
%p
Perry wouldn’t talk about any future plans for Journey. “We had been together for almost ten years. Our collaboration had done so much for each other and to each other that I felt it had run its course.” Cain was disconsolate. “We didn’t want to leave this great big, beautiful Harley-Davidson we had customized sitting in the garage. Neal and I thought we could ride it. But we knew who had the keys.”

The next time the band appeared together in public was the March 1987 Bay Area Music Awards, better known as the Bammies. Schon and Cain performed a couple of songs with bassist Jackson and drummer Narada Michael Walden with a new vocalist Cain was producing – Michael Bolton. Journey won awards for Best Keyboardist, Best Guitarist, Best Vocalist and Best Group. Steve Perry fought back tears after being named Best Vocalist, naming all the current and most of the former members of the band. “They said everybody loves a comeback story,” Cain said, accepting the Best Group plaque. “Some things aren’t so easy to bring back, but we’re here to stay.”
%p
Nothing stirred in the belly of the beast, and the members of Journey went their separate ways. Schon and Cain hooked up with John Waite of the Babys and launched another million-selling band, Bad English. Steve Smith continued to lead his own fusion band, Vital Information, although occasionally artist like Bryan Adams or Mariah Carey, looking for the slow, insinuating groove of the Journey power ballads, would call him for a session.
%p
The old albums sold every day. Radio played the hits. When it was released, the “Greatest Hits” album shot up the charts like a missile in the night. Rolie, Valory and Smith regrouped in 1991 into a band called the Storm along with a guitarist who sounded suspiciously like Neal Schon and a vocalist bearing an uncanny resemblance to Steve Perry.
%p
Journey left not only an indelible mark on the sound of American music, but an appetite for the kind of music the band created. The road the band traveled to find that style led the musicians through many personnel shifts and several entire musical epochs, from the height of jazz-rock fusion through the swarm of haircut bands that suffused the early days of MTV alongside Journey videos. But along the way, Journey followed a path all its own.
